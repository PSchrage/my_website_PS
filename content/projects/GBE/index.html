<p><strong>“The Great Decoupling” at a glance</strong><br />
</p>
<p>“You won’t have the globalization you had in the past. How far you down the road in reversing that is to be determined”. The sentiment expressed in the quotation of Douglas Irwin embodies the view that the ongoing deglobalization will not reach the level of the last great decoupling’s, which the world experienced by time of World War I and the Great Depression. However, the impact of the decoupling between China and the western world is uncertain and depends on the future development.<br />
</p>
<p>The United States (U.S.) pursuing a policy including bans on exports, additional tariffs, and forced reshoring, which was accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, to decouple from China. At the same time, other economies in the world such as Europe and Australia are also considering dissociating from China by dismantling established trade and investment ties. The involved parties in this development possess different themes.<br />
</p>
<p>A central intention consists in safeguarding the supply chains, especially for the U.S. In light of the corona pandemic, the U.S. as well as other countries recognized their dependence on Chinese supply chains and manufacturing production. The shutdown of production plants during the pandemic in China caused a cascade effect throughout the economies in Europe, North America, and Asia. In the wake of this effect, companies becoming aware of the inherent political risk if they are having business relationships with China. Another potential risk companies must be conscious about is the impact on their reputation. Shareholders are emphasizing the resilience of businesses, which is not given without a geographical diversification of supply chains.<br />
</p>
<p>However, it is important to see this on-going situation from an overarching perspective. Despite the above-mentioned reason to be independent or not too dependent from one counterparty, the U.S. is dissociating itself from China for another reason. Pursuing a harsh policy in foreign commerce is part of the race against the geopolitical rival China. Nevertheless, the cooperation with China served the interest of the U.S., the American government seems to be convinced by their own potential benefits resulting from their actions to drive the next big decoupling. The action of the U.S. is not only driven by the Trump administration, but also by the Republicans in general and the Democrats. As a consequence, it seems likely that the intention of the U.S. to decouple from China could outlive the Trump administration.<br />
</p>
<p>In the opinion of Robert Zoellick, the decoupling will not impede China to act in a disruptive way. Slowing down the global trading system will bring its own ripple effect. The subsequent lower growth prospects will result in increasing migration, which will then intensify the political stress between economies.
Does decoupling in this context mean to break ties to another country completely? From the authors´ point of view there is more to this simple term. As aforementioned, the western countries, especially the U.S., heavily relied on Chinese supplies and manufacturing productions. Tearing down these bridges will lead to several problems. The expertise that was outsourced to China must be rebuilt in other countries or domestic regions. The U.S. could set up policies, which are encouraging or forcing companies to do so. Nevertheless, these measures resulting in increasing costs. A main reason for the outsourcing of supply chains lies in the lower level of wages in other countries. Companies who outsourced their production for cost reasons will face issues then and must find an appropriate solution. They might cut their ties to the USA completely and shift their offices as well as production sites to other countries. Given these possible drawbacks, forcing domestic countries to move their supply chains is not reasonable. Even the attempt from the U.S. of rolling out the concept of the “Economic Prosperity Network” could harm the relationship to domestic companies. A more sensitive approach to decoupling must be chosen.<br />
</p>
<p>In order to understand this, a closer look to the various dimensions of decoupling must be taken. Decoupling does not mean to terminate a relationship between two countries suddenly. Decoupling is a process that takes place in different sectors and must be processed step by step. Using the example of the corona virus, the first step of decoupling will likely be seen in the medical sector. Since masks and gloves were difficult to obtain during the crisis, countries like the U.S. will probably try to produce those products outside from China. In the next step governments will likely try to have companies produce other crucial medical products in domestic regions too, ensuring a constant supply. In brief, the decoupling process will possibly begin with certain medical products at first. This will be followed by the attempt to decouple more parts of the medical sector without harming relationships to domestic companies.<br />
</p>
<p>Despite this example, the process of decoupling cannot be executed for all sectors of todays interconnected economy. In a world of globalization every country has its unique production or service sector that cannot be replaced with ease. A complete decoupling from the sector of air transportation for instance would not be useful for the Chinese government, because as today the American company Boeing and the European company Airbus are the world´s most important airplane manufacturers. China first must be able to produce similar products, airplanes in this case, by itself to prevent the Chinese population from losing its living standard and overall wealth.<br />
</p>
<p>The challenge in terms of decoupling is to recognize which parts of a sector or a supply chain can be relocated. Besides insufficient supply chains, governments must bear in mind that other countries will try to decouple too. A cut in exports will likely be the result of the whole procedure which will decrease the current account. This will then increase the capital account by reducing capital outflows and importing countries will receive less funding. As a result, the gross domestic product (GDP) of import and export countries will decline.</p>
<p><strong>The German responsibility</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Before analyzing Germany’s relationship with China, it is important be aware of Germany’s role as part of the European Union (EU). Germany is not only the fourth largest economy in the world, but also the largest national economy in the EU with a share of 24.7% of the EU’s GDP in 2019. Similarly, a decoupled Germany would represent the most important trading partner of the remaining EU states.
Looking at the German economy on a stand-alone basis, China was its largest trading partner in 2019 with a trade turnover of EUR 206 billion (bn). In foreign trade with China, Germany is also one of the few worldwide countries who has an almost balanced trade balance with China (imports: EUR 96bn; exports: EUR 110bn). The EU on the other hand, has a trade deficit with China of EUR 164bn (imports: EUR 362bn; exports: EUR 198bn). With imports worth USD 452bn and exports worth only USD 107bn, the US has an even larger trade deficit with China.
The key question is thus how Germany should respond to the trade conflict continued by President Trump and what position it should take with respect to China.<br />
</p>
<p>By using the example of the mechanical engineering industry while looking at the goods traded between Germany and China, the interdependency between both countries can be seen. Chinese companies produce smaller lower-value components which are used in the production of large machines by German companies. These German machines are demanded by China. This example displays the interdependence between Germany and China. In contrast, the dependency between the U.S. and China is not mutual. Import tariffs from Germany on Chinese goods would lead to rising prices due to higher production costs which would China has to bear. This would probably result in declining exports to China, because China would look for a substitute trading partner. Hence, Germany would encounter lower exports and China higher cost, even if they find a substitute trading partner, resulting in a declining GDP for both countries. Although, this is not applicable for the entire German economy the key industries such as automotive, chemical and mechanical engineering are heavily exposed on the trade with China.<br />
</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany should preserve the existing forms of trade and cooperation with China to serve both sides. In addition to its trade relations, China is also an important player in overcoming international issues such as climate change or global migration, on whose cooperation Germany depend. On the other hand, Germany should also support fair conditions in foreign trade between the EU and China to meet the interest of its European partners.<br />
</p>
<p>The pressure on China to reform could thus be increased, for instance, by increasing the European competitiveness through strengthen of innovation, technology and scientific capacities. To this end, the EU should also work with its third most important trading partner, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), on a common position towards China. However, as the EU’s largest economy, Germany should play a leading role in this process.</p>
